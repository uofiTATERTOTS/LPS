Finds the distance between nodes, using at least four reference nodes to find 
the position of a target node using multilateration by hyperboloids or three 
reference nodes to find the position using trilateration.

lps_stations folder contains simpler code without built in timing or time-out handling.
Note that these files are for Python 3, while the other code is for Python 2 (but that 
can be easily fixed)
