### Instructions for connecting to Ad-Hoc (IBSS) WiFi networks (decentralized, peer to peer)

### Currently need to start network with Linux, then connect with other computers, though
### starting an Ad-hoc network is easy enough on Mac

## Linux:
# Arch can't have NetworkManager started, not sure why yet, need to disable it 
# and reboot and then run these commands, works immediately for RPI

# RPI <device> is wlan0, Jonathan's Arch is wlp2s0
sudo iw <device> set type ibss
# <name> can be anything, <frequency> (MHz) must be center freq of a legal WiFi channel
# look at list of WLAN channels on Wikipedia for US, example: Channel 6 is 2437 MHz
sudo iw <device> ibss join <network_name> <frequency>
# this may be necessary on Arch at least, probably not RPI (try it with wlan0 
# if there is an error in the next step)
sudo ip link set wlp2s0 up
# set ip address and netmask, set x to 1-5 (assuming up to 5 devices connected)
# not sure what netmask does yet, just use this (same for everyone)
sudo ifconfig <device> 192.168.1.x netmask 255.255.255.0

## Mac OSX
# If someone else starts network, just connect like normal network, go into settings
# advance, manually set ip address and netmask, then that needs to be changed back to dhcp

## Windows 10
# After connecting and disconnecting, may need to run troubleshooter to connect to 
# normal networks 

# Needs to be done once for a given network name:
# Go into network and sharing center, new connection, manually, enter ad hoc network name,
# no authentication, don't automatically start or anything
netsh wlan set profileparameter name="network_name" connectiontype=ibss
# Each time, to connect
netsh wlan connecct "network_name"
netsh interface ip set address name=Wi-Fi" source=static addr=192.168.1.x mask=255.255.255.0

# To disconnect
netsh wlan disconnect

# If need to remove profile
netsh wlan delete profile name="network_name"
