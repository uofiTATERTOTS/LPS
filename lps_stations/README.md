These files will carry out an 18 transmission sequence using datagrams. 
IP addresses must be set for each device in lps.py, which must be present in the same directory as each
of the other files (for example balloon1.py needs lps.py available to run).
The number of times the sequence will repeat can be also be set in lps.py, but there is no handling for failed 
transmissions or timing built in.
